Modules are packaged bits of code that this repository uses to fix the problem of VR.

There are only two categories, for the simplicity of this repository.
- System - Anything relating to hardware, or low-level or system-wide programs
- Scripts - Ignore this mostly. The sole purpose is for vr-run, but that is replaced by steam-run.
