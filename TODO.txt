Things I should try:

Create new, completely fresh environment

Factory reset SteamVR

Restart computer

Mesa
Nix-gl with alvr/steamvr
Steam-run with alvr/steamvr

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/alvr-cant-launch-steamvr-steam-desktop-is-not-executable/43845
Running steamvr works through alvr but not through steam
Running steamvr through alvr crashes because of .desktop not found or something
Fix:
xdg.portal = {
    enable = true;
    xdgOpenUsePortal = true;
};

Alvr option

Use monado
Monado config: ~/.config/openxr/1/active_runtime.json
Stuttering with monado?: U_PACING_COMP_MIN_TIME_MS = "5"; to systemd.user.services.monado.environment 
Similarly, setting the cpu Niceness value to a higher priority manually with renice -20 -p $(pgrep monado) could also help.

Test different graphics drivers
Mesa >22

https://wiki.nixos.org/w/index.php?title=VR/ja&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop
Monado and OpenComposite
Also: WiVRn, SteamVR, Envision, and wlx-overlay-s
systemd.user.services.monado.environment = {
  STEAMVR_LH_ENABLE = "1";
  XRT_COMPOSITOR_COMPUTE = "1";
  WMR_HANDTRACKING = "1";
};
Start it via
$ systemctl --user start monado.service
$ journalctl --user --follow --unit monado.service
Need git-lfs btw
